Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend.
Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The summary shows a distinct difference between the two different school types, along with comparisons for other contributing factors in the students' scores. 

Source code and references were obtained from:
- Module 4 Activites
- https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html

*** Error message kept displaying towards the end of the assignment when the provided example code was run. Was unable to find a way to remove the error message from displaying but it does not stop the code from being run, seems to just be a warning.
